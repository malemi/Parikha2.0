Parikha provides the result of a simple application based on Strabil (https://github.com/malemi/Strabil). 

In one single Event, 400 CustomerAgents have a Relationship of customership with a single Seller. The relationship can vary from NoStatus to Gold, depending how much the customers are spending in Goods. 

There is an annual lost, i.e. customers tend to spend less in Goods every year. To avoid that, the Seller has implemented a Loyalty Scheme mechanism with 3+1 Levels, where a fixed (for every Level) amount of money can be spent on Services, still provided by the Seller. In these way Customers have a certain probability to either not spend less in order not to go to a lower Level or to spend more in order to upgrade.
